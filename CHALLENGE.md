===

## Requirements

Implement a `LinkedList` constructor.

* implement `prepend` as a method of your `LinkedList` constructor
  * this should prepend a node with a value *(head)*
* implement `append` as a method of your `LinkedList` constructor
  * this should append a node with a value *(tail)*
* implement `find` as a method of your `LinkedList` constructor
  * `find` should find a node and return it

##### Stretch Goals
Implement `remove` and/or `findMiddle` as a method of your `LinkedList` constructor
  * `remove` should remove a node from the list, keeping the list interconnected after the removal
  * `findMiddle` should find the middle node in the list and return it

## Submission Instructions

1. Together with your assigned partner, pseudocode an implementation for a `List` constructor on the whiteboard.
1. Your partner (or you) should then begin pseudocoding and whiteboarding the solution to a method implementation of their choice.
1. Using the included `whiteboard-rubric.pdf`, evaluate your partner and provide feedback where necessary.
1. Swap roles.
1. Take a picture of your completed whiteboarding rubric and submit in Canvas.
